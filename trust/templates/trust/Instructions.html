        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be participant A;
        the other will be participant B.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives <strong class="text-info">{{Constants.amount_allocated}}</strong>;
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        his <strong class="text-info">{{Constants.amount_allocated}}</strong>
        points to participant B.
        Before B receives these points they will be multiplied by 3. Once B receives
        the tripled points he can decide to send some or all of his points to
        A.
